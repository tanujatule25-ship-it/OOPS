// Concept 10: Function Overriding
// Aim: To override a virtual member function in a derived class.

#include <iostream>

class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void move() const {
        std::cout << "Vehicle is moving\n";
    }
    virtual ~Vehicle() = default;
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void move() const override {
        std::cout << "Car moves on roads\n";
    }
};

class Boat : public Vehicle {
public:
    void move() const override {
        std::cout << "Boat moves on water\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Car car;
    Boat boat;

    car.move();
    boat.move();

    return 0;
}

/*
Expected Output:
Car moves on roads
Boat moves on water

Key learning:
- virtual in the base class enables run-time polymorphic behavior.
- override in the derived class helps the compiler verify the intended override.
